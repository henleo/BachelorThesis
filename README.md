# Detecting Design Thinking Methods from WhiteboardImages using Image Recognition and Crowdsourcing

Code for Bachelor's Thesis will be uploaded here.  

Notebooks with the code for each model that was trained are located in the respectively named directories.  

There is an extra directoy containing the results of all Mechanical Turk trials.

The directory containing the hyperarameter optimization for the pretrained Xception CNN also contains a file from which the trials database can be loaded for inspection.  

If you require the weight files to load the exact models that produced these outputs, please email me. I will send them to you personally, since most of the files exceed GitHub's file size limit of 100MB even if compressed.
