# Bachelor Thesis: Detecting Design Thinking Methods from WhiteboardImages using Image Recognition and Crowdsourcing

The repository contains code and trial results referenced in the above mentioned Bachelor's Thesis.  

Notebooks with the code for each model that was trained are located in the respectively named directories.  

The directory BA_Mechanical_Turk_Results contains the results of all Mechanical Turk trials.

The directory containing the hyperarameter optimization for the pretrained Xception CNN also contains a file from which the trials database can be loaded for inspection.  

If you require the weight files to load the exact models that produced these outputs, please email me.
